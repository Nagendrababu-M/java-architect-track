- **Interview signal:** Code review questions probe these
- **Resources:**
  - *Clean Code* — Robert C. Martin (Chapters 1-3 minimum)
  - "Composition vs Inheritance" — multiple talks

### Day 49a — UML Diagrams for Software Architects: Class, Sequence, Component & ER
- **Core concepts:**
  - **Class diagrams**: associations (plain arrow), aggregation (hollow diamond), composition (filled diamond), dependency (dashed arrow), realization (dashed + hollow triangle), generalization (solid + hollow triangle); multiplicity (`1`, `0..*`, `1..*`); abstract classes vs interfaces; drawing GoF patterns (Strategy, Decorator, Observer) as class diagrams before coding
  - **Sequence diagrams**: lifelines, activation bars, synchronous (`→`) vs async (`→>`) messages; combined fragments — `alt` (if/else), `opt` (optional), `loop` (iteration), `par` (parallel); self-calls; object creation (`new`) and destruction (`X`); sequence diagrams for REST call chains, saga choreography, event-driven fan-out
  - **Component & deployment diagrams**: components with provided/required interfaces; `<<interface>>` stereotype; connectors; mapping microservices to components; nodes and artifacts in deployment diagrams
  - **ER diagrams**: entities, attributes (simple, composite, derived, multi-valued), cardinality (crow's foot notation — one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many); weak entities and identifying relationships; translating ER → normalized relational schema; ER for interviews (schema design questions)
  - **Activity & state-machine diagrams**: activity diagrams for business flows (decision nodes, forks/joins, swimlanes); state-machine diagrams for lifecycle modelling (Order states: pending → confirmed → shipped → delivered → returned)
  - **UML in LLD interviews**: how to sketch a class diagram in the first 5 minutes before writing code; naming conventions; what interviewers actually look for (relationships > methods); common mistakes (over-engineering the diagram)
  - **Tools**: draw.io (free, browser-based), PlantUML (code-first, version-control friendly), Mermaid (markdown-native — renders in GitHub/Notion)
- **Architect lens:** A well-drawn class diagram communicates design in seconds; sequence diagrams are the lingua franca for distributed system discussions with product and infra teams

### Day 62 — CAP Theorem (and Why It's Overhyped)
- **Core concepts:** Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance — what each actually means, the false dichotomy, why "CP vs AP" is too simple
- **Architect lens:** Real systems make per-operation CAP choices, not system-wide
- **Interview signal:** "Is your database CP or AP?" — the architect-level answer is "depends on the operation"
- **Resources:**

  - **Eviction policies:** allkeys-lru, volatile-lru, allkeys-lfu — when to use which
- **Architect lens:** Redis is often the right answer for leaderboards, distributed rate-limiting, pub/sub, session storage, and distributed locks — but wrong answers exist (don't use it as a primary DB)
- **Interview signal:** "Design a real-time leaderboard for 10M users" — Sorted Sets are the answer

  - "Use the Index, Luke!" — use-the-index-luke.com

### Day 69a — Database Normalization: 1NF to BCNF, Denormalization & Practical Trade-offs
- **Core concepts:**
  - **Functional dependencies (FD)**: definition — `X → Y` (X determines Y); trivial vs non-trivial FDs; attribute closure (`X+`); finding candidate keys and superkeys; Armstrong's axioms (reflexivity, augmentation, transitivity)
  - **1NF**: atomicity — no repeating groups, no multi-valued columns, all values same domain; common violations in JSON-column anti-patterns; when PostgreSQL JSONB breaks 1NF
  - **2NF**: no partial dependencies on a composite primary key — worked example: `OrderItem(orderId, productId, productName, quantity)` → `productName` partially depends on `productId` alone; decompose to `OrderItem` + `Product`
  - **3NF**: no transitive dependencies (non-key → non-key) — worked example: `Customer(customerId, city, zipCode, country)` → `country` depends on `zipCode`, not `customerId`; decompose to `Customer` + `Location`
  - **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**: every determinant is a candidate key — stricter than 3NF; example: course-teacher-room scheduling anomaly; when BCNF decomposition loses dependency preservation
  - **4NF**: no multi-valued dependencies — example: `Employee(emp, skill, language)` if skills and languages are independent → decompose into separate tables
  - **Lossless-join vs dependency-preserving decomposition**: can't always guarantee both; the trade-off and when to accept dependency loss
  - **Normalization in practice**: normalize to 3NF/BCNF during initial schema design; document every deliberate deviation
  - **Denormalization patterns**:
    - Materialized aggregates (pre-computed counts, sums stored in parent row)
    - Pre-joined tables for hot read paths (avoids expensive joins at query time)
    - Redundant columns with write-time update strategy (triggers vs application logic)
    - Summary/rollup tables for reporting workloads
  - **OLTP vs OLAP schemas**: normalized 3NF for OLTP (write-heavy, many small transactions); star schema / snowflake schema for OLAP warehouses (denormalized for fast analytical reads); dimension tables, fact tables, slowly changing dimensions (SCD Type 1/2)
  - **Interview patterns**: "Find all normalization violations in this schema"; "Normalize this order table to 3NF step by step"; "Why would you intentionally break 3NF in a high-read-traffic system?"
- **Architect lens:** Most production bugs involving stale or inconsistent data trace back to schema normalization violations; denormalization decisions must be explicit and documented, never accidental
- **Interview signal:** Schema design questions always probe 2NF/3NF understanding; HLD interviews expect you to discuss OLTP vs OLAP schema choice
- **Challenge:** Given a flat `orders` table with 12 columns, identify all FD violations and produce a normalized 3NF schema; then deliberately denormalize one table for a read-heavy dashboard use case and justify it
- **Resources:**
  - *Database Design for Mere Mortals* — Michael J. Hernandez (best normalization book for practitioners)
  - *Fundamentals of Database Systems* — Elmasri & Navathe (Chapter 14-15 for formal FD theory)
  - CMU Database course (Andy Pavlo) — normalization lecture (YouTube, free)

### Day 71 — NoSQL Landscape
- **Core concepts:** Key-value (DynamoDB, Redis), document (MongoDB), wide-column (Cassandra), graph (Neo4j) — when to pick what
- **Architect lens:** "Use NoSQL" is not an answer; "use Cassandra because of write-heavy time-series + tunable consistency" is
- **Resources:**
  - DDIA — Kleppmann, Chapter 2-3
  - "NoSQL Distilled" — Pramod Sadalage

### Day 72 — DynamoDB Design Patterns
- **Core concepts:** Single-table design, partition key + sort key, GSI/LSI, hot partition problem, query vs scan

  - **Distributed ID generation:** Snowflake ID format (41-bit timestamp + 10-bit machineId + 12-bit sequence), Twitter Snowflake vs UUIDv7 vs ULID vs DB sequences, monotonicity guarantees, clock skew hazards (NTP adjustments)
  - Why auto-increment DB IDs don't work across shards
- **Architect lens:** Every high-scale system needs distributed IDs; distributed locking is the #1 correctness pitfall in distributed systems
- **Interview signal:** "Design a globally unique order ID system" — classic Staff/Architect question
- **Resources:**
  - "How we designed Snowflake" — Twitter Engineering blog
  - "Is Redlock safe?" — Martin Kleppmann vs antirez debate (essential reading)

  - **Consumer groups:** partition assignment, rebalancing protocols, sticky vs cooperative rebalance
  - Rebalances are downtime — understand what triggers them
- **Architect lens:** Kafka is not a queue; it's a distributed log. Model your topics accordingly.
- **Resources:**
  - "Kafka: The Definitive Guide" — Neha Narkhede (free PDF from Confluent)
  - Confluent YouTube — Kafka 101 series
  - "Apache Kafka Consumer Internals" — Jason Gustafson talks

### Day 79a — Transactional Outbox Pattern + CQRS Deep Dive
- **Core concepts:**
  - **The dual-write problem:** why writing to DB + publishing an event in the same request is unsafe (no distributed transaction, message can be lost or duplicated)
  - **Transactional Outbox:** write event to an `outbox` table in the same DB transaction as the business entity; a separate poller/CDC reads and publishes
  - **CDC with Debezium:** captures DB transaction log (binlog/WAL), streams changes to Kafka — zero polling overhead
  - **CQRS write vs read model:** event handler updates read-side projection; eventual consistency lag implications for UX
  - Idempotency on the consumer side when using at-least-once delivery
- **Architect lens:** Transactional Outbox is the most reliable pattern for event-driven microservices. "Just write to Kafka and DB in a try-catch" is the #1 production bug in distributed Java systems.

- **Resources:**
  - "Saga Pattern" — Chris Richardson microservices.io
  - microservices.io patterns catalog

### Day 84a — REST API Design + gRPC + WebSockets
- **Core concepts:**
  - **REST:** Richardson Maturity Model, resource naming, idempotency by HTTP verb, versioning strategies (URI vs header vs content negotiation), HATEOAS (when it's worth it)
  - **gRPC:** Protocol Buffers schema-first contract, streaming types (unary, server/client/bidirectional), when gRPC beats REST (service-to-service, strong typing, streaming), protobuf backward compatibility rules
